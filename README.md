# Employee Management System Frontend - React
- **Backend Component** using **Spring Boot & MySQL** is located here: https://github.com/Saad1929/Employee-Management-System
## Brief Summary
- I developed a **RESTful API** using **Spring Boot and MySQL for the backend**, tested it with **Postman**, and integrated it into a **React frontend using axios**.
- **CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE (CRUD)** appliction.
- This repository contains the **frontend** of a **Full Stack** **personal project**, which is **responsible for displaying employee information from the backend** and is implemented using **React** which serves as the **user interface** for the **user**.
- This application allows users to **view, add, remove, and edit** individuals within their management system.
## üéØAims and Motivation
- The main objective of this project was to create a thorough **Full Stack Application** using **Spring Boot & MySQL** as the **backend** and **React** as the **frontend**.
- Driven by an **unwavering enthusiasm** for **learning and self-improvement**, I dedicated my **personal time** to meticulously **develop and refine this Full Stack Application**.
## ‚öôÔ∏èTechnologies, Requirements and Software Tools
- Requirements listed below are for the **frontend and backend**.
### Programming and Scripting Languages
- Java
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- JSON
### Frameworks & Libraries
- Spring Boot - **Backend**
- React - **Frontend**
- Bootstrap - **Frontend & Backend**
### npm Requirements (React)
- nmp axios
- npm react-router-dom
### Other Software Tools
- **MySQLWorkbench** played a role where the **backend** relied on this technology to **store user information**.
- **DataGrip** was also used to support the **backend** in storing user information.
- **Postman** was used to **test PUT, GET, POST and DELETE requests to the database**.
## ‚úèÔ∏èDesign - Frontend
### Frontend Technology Stack
#### React & npm Packages
- The **frontend user interface** of the application was built using **React**, allowing users to **interact and utilise** the application. Additionally, **React** was employed to **retrieve data from the backend and present it on the frontend for user visibility**.
- The **npm axios package** was used to make **HTTP requests, supporting promises, interceptors, and JSON data transformation**.
- More specifically, the **frontend** user interface, built with **React**, utilises **Axios** to enable users to perform **PUT, GET, POST, and DELETE operations** on their information. These actions are **reflected in real-time, updating the corresponding data on the backend**.
- The **npm package react-router-dom** was used to provide components including **`<BrowserRouter>`, `<Switch>`, `<Route>`, and `<Link>`** to handle **client-side routing, rendering different components based on the URL path, and creating navigation links between different pages within the application**.
#### Bootstrap
- **Bootstrap** is a **frontend framework** for building **responsive web pages and applications, offering pre-built components and styles**.
- For this project, **Bootstrap** was employed to **facilitate the construction of the navigation bar**. This feature enables users to **conveniently access** their employee information within the application.
- **Bootstrap** was additionally utilised to aid in the **creation of the table that showcases employee information**. This integration ensures a **visually appealing and responsive table layout** for an **enhanced user experience**.
